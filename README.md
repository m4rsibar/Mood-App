## About
The way I approached this project was simple. I wanted to create an application that could keep and visualize a history of individualized data.
I decided to use mood data, that is, how I was feeling at that particular time.  The data is recorded using a 1-5 range.  Only one mood can be recorded a day, and an optional comment can be attatched and displayed on the graph.
